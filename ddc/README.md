# Converting Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) from MARC/XML to JSKOS

The Dewey Decimal Classificaiion (DDC) is managed by OCLC with software by Pansoft. The DDC data is only made available internally in [MARC 21 Classification format](http://www.loc.gov/marc/classification/) as MARC/XML. This must be provided manually as .zip file (e.g. `ddc23de.zip`).

To convert this format to SKOS and JSKOS, two methods exist:

* The command line tool [mc2skos](https://pypi.org/project/mc2skos/) was created to convert this format to SKOS. Limited export to JSKOS is also supported, but some adjustment of the result may be needed.

* Catmandu script `ddc2jskos.fix` directly convert DDC in MARC/XML to JSKOS.

## mc2skos

Install mc2skos

    pip3 install --upgrade --user mc2skos

Make sure the Python binary path is added to `$PATH` in `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or `.bash_profile`.

    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

An extracted DDC file in MARC/XML can be converted to almos-JSKOS via:

    mc2skos -o ndjson --uri http://dewey.info/scheme/edition/e23/  $DDCFILE

Additional command line options to consider include `--exclude_notes` and `--components`.

The resulting NDJSON file requires some post-processing to get valid JSKOS.

## Catmandu

Install Catmandu::MARC:

    cpanm --installdeps .

Then convert each language independently:

    unzip -p ddc23en.zip | catmandu convert marcxml --fix 'add_field(language,en)' --fix ddc2jskos.fix to ndjson > ddc23en.ndjson

`Makefile` is also configured to convert DDC via Catmandu:

```sh
# By default, German DDC (`de`) and version 23 is used
make
# To convert a different language:
make lang=en
# To convert a different version (note: untested):
make version=22
```
